# Why Markdown?
- Easy to learn
- Platform-independent
- Fast to write
- Clear and readable
- Ideal for technical documentation

<!-- 
Speaker notes:
Markdown was developed to provide an easy way to format text files without affecting their readability. It's used in many fields, especially in software development, where technical documentation needs to be created quickly and efficiently.
-->

# Syntax Overview
- Headings: `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.
- Bold and Italics: `**bold**`, `*italic*`
- Lists: `-` or `1.`
- Links: `[Text](URL)`
- Code blocks: \```\`\ for multiple lines

<!--
Speaker notes:
Markdown syntax is simple and straightforward. It uses minimal markup to allow for quick structuring of text. Nearly every formatting feature we know from word processors can be implemented with just a few characters.
-->
