For your assignment it is neccessary, that you show me as a group that you understood everything we talked about.
The main parts of it are:

1. Variables
2. Conditions
3. Methods
4. Lists & Dictionaries
5. Objects & Classes
6. Libraries & Modules

Those 6 items are an absolute must have for Azure, for Scratch the first 4 are neccessary.

The most important part of scratch is, that you have a nice program. Here the visual (& sound?) aspects are very important, that the program is nice to use. The focus of the Azure part is more on the technical side, you can let your inner geek run free.

The strengths of Scratch are Games, interactive Movies, Multiple Choice questionnaires.

The strength of python in Azure/Jupyter Notebooks is Data Analysis, Machine Learning (not required!), simulation, Combination of Documentation and program.
